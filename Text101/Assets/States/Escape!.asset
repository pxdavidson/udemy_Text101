  storyText: 'You enter the hallway, glad you be at least a walls thickness from your
    persuers.


    In front of you is a set of stairs that lead down to a hallway. To the left you
    see an open door with a motorbike. You rush down the stairs and jump on the bike,
    wheeling it backwards into the house and pointing it towards the front door.


    You twist the key in the ignition and the engine roars to life, no doubt alerting
    those in the adjacent house of your presence. But you don''t care, twisting the
    throttle you launch forward out onto the road and into the rain swept night.


    Finally an escape!


    Press 1 to play again.'
