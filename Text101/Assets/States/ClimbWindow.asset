  storyText: 'You duck into the bedroom and move swiftly accross the floor, being
    careful not to step on any of the various toys left scattered after the previous
    occupant departed.


    Climbing out the window you find a narrow ledge that you could shimmy along to
    the next house.


    You hear voices on the stairs coming up and decide you have no choice but to push
    out into the rain slicked ledge.


    Making your way sowly and carefully, flinching every time lightning lashes accross
    the sky you eventually reach a window into a darkened hallway.


    Press 1 to continue...'
