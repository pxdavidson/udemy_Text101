  storyText: 'You scramble over rubble, your feet slipping on loose bricks as the
    rain splashes off graffitti scrawled concrete onto your face.


    Finding a handhold you catch your breath, the taste of blood fills our mouth and
    you spit red, glinting in the moonlight onto the muddied ground.


    You hear the sound of dogs and you heave a deep breath your lungs burning and
    legs aching. Ahead of you see a smashed window and a darkened staircase beyond.


    1. Stay where you are and hope your pursuers miss you in the debris.

    2. Sprint for the window.'
