  storyText: 'Grasping the rotten beams you make your way up into the attic. You slip
    briefly, banging your hip against the wet wood but regain your footing as you
    hear voices at the bottom of the stairs.


    Hauling yourself into the attic you look around and see someone has knocked through
    the dividing wall between the current house and the next house.


    Water has got in here too and rotted through the floorboards; a big section in
    the middle is sagging. The voices on the stairs are growing louder as they ascend.
    You could take a running jump and cross quickly or crawl along the drier sections
    under the eaves of the roof.


    1. Take a run up and jump

    2. Take it slow and crawl'
